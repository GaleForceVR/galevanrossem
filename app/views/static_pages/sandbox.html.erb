    <h3 class="greeting">Hi, I'm Gale.</h3>
    <p>I was once assigned the task of memorizing a poem of my choice and I picked "The Road Less Traveled" by Robert Frost.</p>
    <blockquote>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I â€”
        I took the one less traveled by,
        And that has made all the difference.<p class="attribution">Robert Frost</p></blockquote>
    <p>It was my favorite poem. However, I never realized how apropos it was to my life until many years later. I definitely took the path that few dared tread.</p>
    <p>That choice has taken me down a road of uncertainty, risk, reward, trials, tribulations and even failure at times.</p>
    <p>Today, one thing is for certain.I wouldn't change it for the world!</p>
    <p>My experiences on that road have forever altered my destiny. I stand before you now ready to conquer whatever life throws my way.</p>

<p>If you are looking for someone who is dedicated, loves web development, can learn quickly, and isn't afraid to ask questions, then you've found the right guy. I can't wait to take my game to the next level, and I plan on taking my new company there with me.</p>

      <p>From the time I was a kid, I've always been a builder. From model rockets and model railroads to remote control cars and planes.</p>
      <p>As an adult, I built a sign out of wood that stood 12 feet tall in the back of a truck, and I designed my own logos and print materials for some of my business ventures.</p>
      <p>Of course, I built websites as well. First for Madisen's Match, and then the Kiwanis Club. I also built some sites for potential businesses. A fantasy football blog site and then basketball themed site called Dunk City, FL.</p>
      <p>Most recently, I dreamed up, built, and ran an entire e-commerce t-shirt printing company by myself.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, my passion for visual design and craftsmanship led me to Dev Bootcamp and a chance to pursue my perfect career.</p>

<h1 class="home-headline">Other Things I've Built</h1>
<p>From the time I was a kid, I've always been a builder. From model rockets and model railroads to remote control cars and planes.</p>
<p>I've continued to build things throughout my life and I often find creative solutions to problems. As an entrepreneur, I've always had to find ways to do more with less money.</p>
<p>When I needed to raise sales, I built a sign out of wood that stood 12 feet tall in the back of a truck, and I designed my own logos and print materials for some of my business ventures.</p>
<p>As a Graphic Designer, I always pushed the envelope of my current skill level. I once wrapped a boat for a marketing campaign despite never having done so before.</p>
<p>Wrap-A-Tee.com was an attempt to take advantage of the relatively new process of Direct to Garment printing. When I found that I was wasting t-shirts and ink because there was no system to align the shirts properly, I designed and built my own shirt alignment table.</p>
<p>I'm always looking for new ways to do things. I am always learning and always open to try new approaches.</p>
